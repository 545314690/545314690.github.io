00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:11,533
amazing Grace how sweet the sound

2
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:20,199
that saved a wretch like me

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:33,866
I once was lost but now I'm found

4
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:42,799
was blind but now I see

5
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:56,399
it was Grace that taught my heart to fear

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,600
andGrace my fears relieved

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:17,766
how precious did that Grace appear

8
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,966
the hour I first believed

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:39,333
through many dangers toils and snares

10
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:46,966
we have already come

11
00:01:50,600 --> 00:02:00,133
TWAS Grace that brought us safe thus far

12
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:08,466
and Grace will lead us home

13
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:22,299
when we've been there 10,000 years

14
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,900
bright shining as the sun

15
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:43,366
we know less days to sing god's praise

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,500
than when we've first begun

17
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:06,333
amazing Grace how sweet the sound

18
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:14,899
that saved a wretch like me

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,666
I once was lost but now I'm found

20
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:40,099
